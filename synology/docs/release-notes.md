# Release notes


## 1.37.4-0011: SDK 0.38.2 rebuild

Built with SDK/App 0.38.2, CLI 0.41.9, templates 0.35.5 and executor v0.38.2.
The install wizard now offers the gateway HTTPS and sign-in (OIDC issuer) ports; upgrades keep the saved ports.
Vaultwarden reads its sign-in authority from the selected issuer port instead of a fixed 29090.
Fixed DSM menu sign-in: only native-client `/identity` paths (`/identity/connect/token`, `/identity/accounts`, `/identity/sso`) use upstream authentication, so the browser authorization redirect goes through the DSM gate again.
Added the `npm run e2e:smoke` App-open check (administrator, non-administrator access denied, signed out).
Protected executor payloads changed: administrator approval is required again after upgrading.

## 1.37.4-0010: SDK entry-gate migration

Built with SDK/App/templates 0.32.0, CLI 0.34.0 and executor v0.32.0.
Only `/api`, `/identity`, `/notifications`, `/attachments`, `/events`, `/icons` use upstream authentication; all other browser paths retain the DSM entry gate.
Protected executor payloads changed: administrator approval is required again after upgrading.
No NAS installation or device acceptance was performed for this rebuild.

## 1.37.4-0009 — Redesigned DSM menu launch page

- The page shown when an App can't be opened from the DSM menu is redesigned and now explains when the App's port isn't reachable from outside
- 重新設計從 DSM 選單無法開啟 App 時顯示的頁面，並說明 App 的連接埠無法從外部連線的情況
